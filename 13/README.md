## Decision Trees and their Ensembles

Hey Everyone, today we will be learning about What Decision Trees are, how they work and how we can increase their performance by making an ensemble.

Link for the content is given below:

- Basic Decision Tree models [link](./Decision_Trees.ipynb)
- Decision Tree Ensembles [link](./Decision_Tree_Ensembles-Bagging_and_Boosting.ipynb) 
- Task for the topic [link](./Decision_Tree_Task.ipynb)
- Task Data [link](./task_data.csv)

### Task:

Using all the resources and the data given to you, make some kind of visual representing how the decision tree looks for the given task dataset. The Column that you need to predict here is the 'Survived' column.
